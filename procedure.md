To evaluate the impact of key system parameters on the probability of coverage and outage in a wireless communication system. please follow the following steps:
  1) Enter the input values Total transmit power (Pt), Minimum power threshold (Pmin), Environment type, and Carrier frequency (fc).
  2) Select mode to choose the type of obstacle.
  3) Click on any place on the grid to place an obstacle.
  4) Observe the following results by moving the cursor on the grid:
     - If the recieved power is below the threshold, the cell is in outage.
     - A higher transmit power improves coverage probability.
     - A longer distance reduces coverage due to path loss.
  5) Repeat the experiment for different values of input parameters to analyze trends.
