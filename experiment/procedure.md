To evaluate the impact of key system parameters on the probability of coverage and outage in a wireless communication system. please follow the following steps:
  1) Enter the input values Total transmit power (Pt), Minimum power threshold (Pmin), Distance between transmitter and receiver (r), and Carrier frequency (fc).
  2) Click on calculate and observe the following results:
     
     2.1) If the recieved power is below the threshold, the system is in outage.
     
     2.2) A higher transmit power improves coverage probability.
     
     2.3) A longer distance reduces coverage due to path loss.
  3) Repeat the experiment for different values of input parameters to analyze trends.
