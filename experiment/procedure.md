To evaluate the impact of key system parameters on the probability of coverage and outage in a wireless communication system, please follow the following steps:
  1) Enter the input values for total transmit power (Pt), threshold power (Pmin), environment type, and carrier frequency (fc).
  2) Select the obstacle density (Can be interpreted a).
  3) Click on any place on the grid to place an obstacle.
  4) Observe the following results by moving the cursor on the grid:
     - If the recieved power is below the threshold, the cell is in outage.
     - A higher transmit power improves coverage probability.
     - A longer distance reduces coverage due to path loss.
  5) Repeat the experiment for different values of input parameters to analyze trends.
