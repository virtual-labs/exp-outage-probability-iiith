      "question": "What does outage probability represent in wireless communication?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The likelihood that a transmitter will fail",
        "b": "The probability that the received signal falls below a minimum threshold",
        "c": "The probability of achieving maximum signal quality",
        "d": "The average power of the transmitted signal"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect – this refers to hardware reliability, not signal performance.",
        "b": "Correct – outage probability is the chance the received signal is below a set threshold.",
        "c": "Incorrect – this is unrelated to outage probability definition.",
        "d": "Incorrect – outage probability is not about average transmitted power."

      "question": "What is the coverage area in a wireless communication system?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The area where a signal can be received with acceptable quality",
        "b": "The area within a transmitter’s physical boundary",
        "c": "The area where all users have maximum signal strength",
        "d": "The area beyond which the signal strength is zero"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct – coverage area is where signal meets minimum quality requirements.",
        "b": "Incorrect – physical boundary does not define RF coverage.",
        "c": "Incorrect – not all locations have maximum signal.",
        "d": "Incorrect – some signal may still be present beyond coverage area."

      "question": "Outage probability depends on which of the following?",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Partially correct – but not the only factor.",
        "b": "Partially correct – but not the only factor.",
        "c": "Correct – both the target threshold and distance affect outage probability.",

      "question": "If a cell has a low outage probability, which of the following is likely true?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The cell has poor signal coverage",
        "b": "The cell provides consistent signal quality",

        "d": "The cell requires additional transmitters"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect – low outage means better coverage.",
        "b": "Correct – low outage means fewer drops and stable performance.",
        "c": "Incorrect – high outage probability would cause dropped calls.",
        "d": "Incorrect – low outage does not indicate lack of transmitters."

      "question": "Which of the following is a common method to improve coverage in a wireless network?",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct – more base stations reduce distance and improve coverage.",
        "b": "Incorrect – smaller antennas usually reduce gain.",
        "c": "Incorrect – while less load helps, it doesn’t directly reduce outage probability.",
        "d": "Incorrect – more noise makes performance worse."
