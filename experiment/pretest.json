      "explanations": {
        "a": "Outage depends on other factors too",
        "b": "Outage depends on other factors too",
        "c": "Correct answer!",

      "question": "If a cell has a low outage probability, which of the following is likely true?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The cell has poor signal coverage",
        "b": "The cell provides consistent signal quality",
        "c": "Users frequently experience dropped calls",
        "d": "The cell requires additional transmitters"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Cell with lower outage probability assures higher coverage",
        "b": "Correct answer!",
        "c": "Cell with lower outage probability assures higher coverage and thus does not experience dropped calls",
        "d": "Cell with lower outage probability assures higher coverage and thus does not require extra transmitters",
